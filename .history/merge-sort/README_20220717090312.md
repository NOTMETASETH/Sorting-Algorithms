Mergesort

Mergesort works by dividing the array into subarrays until each array has one element.
Then, each subarray is concatenated(merged) in a sorted order

//***********************************

The merge function should add all the elements from both arrays in sorted order in a “result array.”

To do this, the index of each array can be created to keep track of elements already compared.

Once one array exhausts all its elements, the rest can be appended to the result array.

--------------------------------------------

The merging function works by taking the two arrays (left and right) and merging them into one resultant array.

The elements need to be compared as they get merged to preserve order.

Now, the mergeSort function has to partition the bigger array into two separate arrays and recursively call merge.
