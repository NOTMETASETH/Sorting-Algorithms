// The merge sort algorithm (continued)

// The merge sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm. The idea behind it is to divide the original array into smaller arrays until each small array has only one position, and then merge these smaller arrays into bigger ones until we have a single big array at the end that is sorted.
