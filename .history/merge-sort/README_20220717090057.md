// Mergesort

// Mergesort works by dividing the array into subarrays until each array has one element.

// Then, each subarray is concatenated(merged) in a sorted order

// The merge function should add all the elements from both arrays in sorted order in a “result array.”

// To do this, the index of each array can be created to keep track of elements already compared.

// Once one array exhausts all its elements, the rest can be appended to the result array.
